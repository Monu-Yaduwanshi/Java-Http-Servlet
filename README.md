This repository contains a simple Java Servlet example that demonstrates how to create a web application using the HttpServlet class. The servlet responds to HTTP requests and generates dynamic HTML content, showcasing the fundamentals of servlet development.

# 🌐 Java-Http-Servlet Example 🌐

Welcome to the **Java-Http-Servlet** project! This repository provides a simple yet powerful demonstration of using the **HttpServlet** class to create dynamic web content. It’s an excellent starting point for anyone looking to learn the basics of Java servlet development and dynamic HTML generation. Dive into this project to explore the fundamentals of server-side Java programming!

## ✨ Features

- **📄 Dynamic Content Generation**:
  - The servlet dynamically generates **HTML** content in response to **HTTP requests**, showcasing how to build interactive web pages using Java.

- **🔗 Simple Navigation**:
  - A user-friendly navigation link allows users to easily return to the home page for a seamless experience.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Java Servlet API**:
  - Implements the **HttpServlet** class to handle **GET** and **POST** requests, demonstrating the core concepts of servlet development.

- **Apache Tomcat**:
  - Serves as the **web server** to deploy and run the servlet application, ensuring smooth handling of HTTP requests and responses.

- **MySQL Database** *(Future Potential)*:
  - While not integrated yet, the project is structured to allow easy integration of **MySQL** for data storage in future iterations.

- **Eclipse IDE**:
  - Developed using **Eclipse IDE**, making it easy to manage and modify the project structure and servlet configurations.
